## Overview

A test notebook as a playground for release process

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        bash setup.sh
        ```

    This will:
    * Create a virtual environment.
    * Install the required dependencies (including your client library).
    * Launch Jupyter Lab (you can change it to launch the classic notebook interface if you prefer).
